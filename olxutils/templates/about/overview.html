  <h2>About This Course</h2>

  <p>The <strong>OpenStack Deployment and Operations</strong> course
     is our self-paced basic course for fundamental OpenStack
     knowledge. It is the base for all our other OpenStack training
     modules and will enable you to deeply understand the basic ideas
     behind OpenStack and the general structure of the platform.</p>

  <p>This course has a total of 38 <strong>units</strong>, out of
     which 16 are interactive <strong>lab exercises</strong>. Lab
     exercises vary from about 30 to 90 minutes in length. Overall, it
     is possible to complete the entire course in a matter of 2-3 days
     in one go, but we recommend to spread out your lessons: for best
     results, plan to do about 2-3 units, including one lab, every day
     or every other day. If you follow that recommendation, you will
     complete the course in about 2-4 weeks â€” but if a different
     schedule suits you better, go with what works best for you!</p>
